# Machine Learning Explorations

## Business Problem

### Description

Data Money company believes that the expertise in training and fine-tuning algorithms, carried out by the company's Data Scientists, is the main reason for the excellent results that the consultancies have been delivering to their clients.

### Objective

The objective of this project will be to carry out tests with Classification, Regression and Clustering algorithms, to study the change in performance behavior, as the values ​​of the main overfitting and underfitting control parameters change.

## Solution planning

### Final Product

The final product will be 7 tables showing the performance of the algorithms, evaluated using multiple metrics, for 3 different data sets: Training, validation and testing.

### Tested algorithms

#### Classification:

- Algoritmos: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest e Logistic Regression
- Métricas de performance: Accuracy, Precision, Recall e F1-Score
